## In Permaculture Terms

Think of this licensing approach like **open-pollinated seeds** versus **patented hybrids**:

- **MIT (code):** "Here's my tool. Use it, modify it, share it. Just say where it came from."
- **CC BY-SA (content):** "Here's my knowledge. Teach it, adapt it, improve it. Credit the source, and share your improvements the same way."

We believe knowledge wants to be free, like spores on the wind. This licensing ensures the work can spread while maintaining the chain of attribution that honors everyone who contributes.
