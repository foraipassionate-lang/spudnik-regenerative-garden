# 🧪 Innovation: Kombucha Calcium Extraction (WCA)

*Using sour/over-fermented kombucha instead of vinegar for Water-Soluble Calcium production*

---

## The Problem

Traditional KNF Water-Soluble Calcium (WCA) requires:
- Roasted eggshells or oyster shells
- Brown rice vinegar (purchased)
- 7-14 day extraction period

Brown rice vinegar works well but must be purchased. In a closed-loop system, we look for alternatives already present in the household waste stream.

---

## The Hypothesis

**Over-fermented kombucha contains significant acetic acid** (the same acid in vinegar). When kombucha is left too long, acetobacter bacteria convert the alcohol to acetic acid, creating a sour, vinegar-like liquid.

This "failed" kombucha should work identically to vinegar for calcium extraction.

---

## The Science

### Acid Content Comparison

| Acid Source | Acetic Acid % | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| White vinegar | 5-7% | Standard |
| Brown rice vinegar | 4-5% | Traditional KNF |
| Apple cider vinegar | 5-6% | Common alternative |
| **Sour kombucha** | **2-4%** | Varies by fermentation |

Sour kombucha has slightly lower acidity, which means:
- Extraction may take longer
- May need more volume
- Results are still effective

## The Process

### Materials
- 500g eggshells (collected, rinsed, dried)
- 1L+ sour/over-fermented kombucha
- Glass jar with loose lid
- Patience

### Method

1. **Roast shells** at 200°C for 20-30 minutes until white/grey
2. **Crush** shells into small pieces (mortar & pestle or rolling pin)
3. **Add to jar** and cover with kombucha (10:1 liquid to shell ratio)
4. **Wait** — bubbling indicates reaction (CO2 release as calcium dissolves)
5. **Stir daily** and add more kombucha if needed
6. **Complete** when bubbling stops (shells mostly dissolved)
7. **Strain** and store in sealed container

### Timeline

- **Vinegar method:** 7-14 days
- **Kombucha method:** 10-21 days (longer due to lower acidity)

---

## Observations

### What Worked
- Shells dissolved completely given enough time
- Final liquid has characteristic brownish color
- No difference in plant response compared to vinegar WCA
- Uses material that would otherwise be discarded

### What to Watch For
- Kombucha with active SCOBY may continue fermenting—remove SCOBY first
- Very weak kombucha (low acidity) may not work—taste test for sourness
- Keep lid loose initially (CO2 pressure buildup)

---

## Applications

The resulting WCA is used identically to traditional preparation:
- **Foliar spray:** 1:1000 dilution
- **Soil drench:** 1:500 dilution
- **Target crops:** Tomatoes, peppers, cucurbits (blossom end rot prevention)
- **Timing:** During fruiting stage

## Waste Stream Integration

```
Kitchen → Eggshells (waste) + Sour Kombucha (waste) → WCA → Healthier crops → Kitchen
```

Two waste streams combine to create a valuable amendment. This is permaculture principle #6 (Produce No Waste) in action.

---

## Alternative Shell Sources

The same process works with:
- Oyster shells (from seafood consumption)
- Mussel shells (common in Belgian cuisine)
- Clam shells
- Crab/lobster shells (also add chitin benefits)

Different shells may require different processing (harder shells need more crushing/longer extraction).

---

## Further Research Needed

- [ ] Measure actual calcium content (lab test vs store-bought WCA)
- [ ] Test extraction efficiency with different kombucha ages
- [ ] Compare shell dissolution rates across shell types
- [ ] Determine optimal kombucha acidity threshold

---

## Bonus: WCP from Bones

The same sour kombucha can be used for Water-Soluble Calcium Phosphate (WCP):
- Use roasted/charred bones instead of shells
- Bones dissolve slower—allow 3-4 weeks
- Results in calcium + phosphorus for root/flower development
