## Introduction

Jean Pain (1928-1981) was a French forester and inventor who developed a revolutionary method for transforming forest brushwood into high-quality humus while simultaneously extracting energy in the form of hot water and methane gas. Working in the harsh conditions of Provence—rocky soil, extreme summer heat, and water scarcity—he proved that 'waste' biomass could regenerate even the most degraded soils.

This protocol adapts his methods for garden-scale implementation, focusing on the core composting process that produces what Pain called 'Living Humus'—the fundamental food of the soil.

## Core Philosophy

- **Variety is essential:** Use diverse plant materials without selection or preference. Balance comes from diversity itself.
- **Precision matters:** The dimensions and procedures must be 'scrupulously respected' for success.
- **Surface application:** Young compost feeds soil from above, mimicking natural forest floor processes.
- **Closed-loop thinking:** Forest 'waste' becomes fertility. Energy generated offsets labor costs.

## Critical Parameters

The following parameters must be maintained for successful composting:

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Heap Base Width | **2.20 meters** | Must be exact for proper airflow |
| Heap Center Height | **1.60 meters** | Triangular cross-section |
| Moisture Content | **40-50%** | Maintain throughout process |
| Target Temperature | **60-75°C** | Thermophilic zone |
| Branch Diameter | **≤ 8mm** | For manual composting |
| Minimum Volume | **4 m³** | For adequate fermentation |

## Phase 1: Raw Material Gathering

**Duration:** 1-3 days

Gather diverse brushwood from forest understory, hedgerows, or garden prunings. The key principle is variety—every plant species contributes unique minerals and microbial communities.

### Acceptable Materials
- Oak, pine, heather, thyme, rosemary, lavender, broom, juniper
- Fern, euphorbia, daphne, rue, salsaparilla
- Any plants without exception—variety is key

### Restrictions
- **Maximum branch diameter: 8mm** for manual composting
- You are thinning, not clearing—preserve forest structure

---

## Phase 2: Impregnation

**Duration:** 1-3 days

**⚠️ This is where most people fail.** Jean Pain was emphatic about thorough water saturation.

### Method 1: Barrel Bath (Recommended)
1. Fill non-metallic container with brushwood
2. Press down firmly with heavy stone
3. Fill completely with water
4. Leave 1-3 days
5. Fork out, drain well, add to heap

### Method 2: Spray Watering
Apply water in short, repeated sprayings until fully saturated.

### Method 3: Rain Immersion
Turn material in driving rain, heap quickly. Last resort only.

## Phase 3: Pre-Composting

**Duration:** 3 weeks

Heap material loosely and allow initial fermentation.

### Signs of Progress
- Heap sinks and softens
- Color changes to brownish
- Develops sour smell
- Becomes slightly warm

### The Carding Process
After 3 weeks, 'card' the material:
1. Take fork with prongs DOWN
2. Tap heap edge vigorously to unravel and shred
3. Process entire heap (~1.5 hours)

---

## Phase 4: Heap Construction

**Duration:** ~2 hours

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Measurements must be scrupulously respected.

### Required Dimensions
- **Base width: 2.20 meters**
- **Center height: 1.60 meters**
- **Shape: Triangular** cross-section

### Construction Steps
1. Mark 2.20m base on level ground
2. Fork material layer by layer
3. **DO NOT compress**—crucial for airflow
4. Toss into central axis, let fall naturally
5. Add 2cm earth coating
6. Cover with large boughs 'like roof of hut'

### Why This Geometry Works
- **Surface area:** Triangular shape maximizes gas exchange
- **Convection:** Peak creates chimney effect—heap breathes naturally
- **Moisture:** Slopes prevent waterlogging, maintain 40-50%
- **Heat balance:** Optimal ratio prevents over/under-heating

---

## Phase 5: Active Fermentation

**Duration:** 90 days (Day 21-111)

The heap reaches 60-75°C as thermophilic bacteria devour material.

### Monitoring
- **Temperature:** Check weekly, target 60°C average
- **Moisture:** Maintain 40-50%
- **Protection:** Repair roof after storms

### Troubleshooting
- **Too cold (<50°C):** Add water
- **Ammonia smell:** Add carbon
- **Putrid smell:** Check drainage, add air

---

## Phase 6: Maturation & Use

### 90-Day Compost: Surface Only
Apply ON TOP of soil only. Do not incorporate.

### 18-Month Compost: Full Use
Can incorporate into top 10cm after passing the **Crushing Test**:
1. Take thickest wood piece
2. Crush between thumb and forefinger
3. **Crumbles = ready**; Resists = wait longer

**⚠️ WARNING:** Incorporating unfinished compost causes 'blockage'—soil exhausts itself digesting coarse material, damaging plants for 1-2 years.

## Timeline Summary

| Day | Phase | Activities |
|-----|-------|------------|
| 1-3 | Gathering | Collect brushwood, begin impregnation |
| 1-21 | Pre-composting | Initial fermentation |
| ~21 | Construction | Card material, build 2.20m × 1.60m heap |
| 21-111 | Fermentation | Thermophilic decomposition, monitor weekly |
| 111+ | Surface Use | Apply ON TOP of soil only |
| 540+ | Incorporation | After crushing test, can mix into soil |
