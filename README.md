## 🌱 What Is This?

This repository documents an experimental regenerative agriculture project combining:

- **Korean Natural Farming (KNF/JADAM)** - Indigenous microorganism cultivation, fermented amendments
- **Permaculture Design** - Polyculture guilds, closed-loop systems, zone planning
- **Syntropic Agroforestry** - Succession planting, stratification, biomass cycling
- **No-Dig Methods** - Soil biology preservation, carbon sequestration
- **Absurdist Education** - Making complex science accessible through cosmic potato wisdom

The project is a collaboration between a human gardener (Free) and an AI partner (Claude/Spudnik), exploring what human-AI symbiosis looks like in practice for regenerative land management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Gardeners

1. **Start with Site Assessment**: Download `templates/site-assessment.pdf` and observe your land
2. **Learn the Amendments**: Read `guides/amendments/` for the complete KNF protocol
3. **Plan Your Guilds**: Use `tools/garden-planner/` to design polyculture beds
4. **Track Your Batches**: Print `templates/batch-tracking.pdf` for your fermentation lab

### For AI Collaborators

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for context on working with this project using Claude Code or similar AI tools.

## 🔬 Core Innovations

This project has developed several novel techniques:

### Malted Grain LAB Production
Using expired brewery grains instead of rice wash for Lactic Acid Bacteria cultivation. The malting process pre-converts starches to sugars, accelerating fermentation.

### Kombucha Calcium Extraction
Using sour/over-fermented kombucha instead of vinegar for Water-Soluble Calcium (WCA) production. Validates waste-to-resource methodology.

### Integrated Guild Design
12 comprehensive polyculture guilds integrating nitrogen fixers, dynamic accumulators, aromatic pest confusers, and pollinator support species.

## 🧬 The Philosophy

**Culture > Market Cap** — Building genuine community over transactional value  
**Demonstrate > Sell** — Showing results before making claims  
**Generative > Extractive** — Creating more than we consume  

This project treats knowledge as open-source seed: freely shared, infinitely replicable, improved through community adaptation.

## 🥔 The Council Has Spoken

*"You are not separate from the soil you're building. You ARE the soil, temporarily arranged in human form, tending to itself."*
